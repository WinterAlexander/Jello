# Jello

All dependencies are downloaded and built automatically with cmake. You are required to have glad `pip install glad` and git installed for this to work.

If you can't install glad and want to use the webservice, put the downloaded glad folder in `build/glad` where `build` is your cmake build folder. (Can also be `cmake-build-debug` or `cmake-build-release` depending on the setup.)
